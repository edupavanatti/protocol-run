# Protocol: Run
Protocol: Run is a (Not) Endless Runner developed with Unity for Mobile devices.

This simple game was developed for study purposes and may (or may not) evolve into a complete game in the future.
Please notice that the game is still under development, so issues are expected. Also, it's only available for Android devices for now (version 6.0 and above).

This repository includes a more in-depth project documentation, detailing an overview of the architecture and design patterns utilized, as well as instructions on how to play and set the game's configuration.
A test Android APK is also provided within the repository, and will be constantly updated as newer versions are released.
